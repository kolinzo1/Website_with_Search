# User Story

### User Story 1: Search for GIFs
**As a** user,  
**I want to** be able to enter a keyword and search for related GIFs,  
**So that** I can find and view GIFs that interest me or are relevant to my current needs.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - There must be an input field for keywords.
  - A search button should trigger the API call with the entered keyword.
  - The system should handle basic input validation (e.g., not allowing empty searches).
  - Results should be displayed after a short delay post-search.

### User Story 2: Browse GIFs in a Grid Layout
**As a** user,  
**I want to** see search results displayed in a grid layout,  
**So that** I can easily scan through multiple GIFs at once without needing to scroll horizontally.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - GIFs should be displayed in a responsive grid that adjusts to screen size.
  - Each GIF thumbnail should be clickable, possibly leading to a larger view or download option.
  - The grid should be optimized for both desktop and mobile, ensuring visibility and usability on smaller screens.

### User Story 3: Responsive Design for Mobile Users
**As a** mobile user,  
**I want** all elements of the website, including search functionality and image display, to be easily accessible and visually appealing on my device,  
**So that** I can use the site effectively on-the-go without needing to switch to a desktop.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The search form should be easily accessible with touch inputs, possibly with larger buttons or areas for tapping.
  - The layout should automatically adjust for smaller screens, potentially changing from a horizontal input form to a vertically stacked one.
  - Images in the grid should be touch-friendly, with enough space to tap without accidentally selecting adjacent images.
